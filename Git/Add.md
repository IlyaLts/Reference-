- #### Stage a file
```git add <file>```

- #### Stage a directory
```git add <direcotry>```

- #### Stage everything 
```git add .```

- #### Interactive staging  
```git add -p```  
Begin an interactive staging session that lets you choose portions of a file to add to the next commit. This will present you with a chunk of changes and prompt you for a command. Use y to stage the chunk, n to ignore the chunk, s to split it into smaller chunks, e to manually edit the chunk, and q to exit.
